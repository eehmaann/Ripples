						<h2>Vera’s Story</h2>
						<p>My story begins when “life happened”.  You know how it is.  You are barreling down the road of life.  What you do makes you feel vital; everything made sense; all was well.  Then, out of nowhere, your beautiful road became a sink-hole with no clear way out.</p>  
						<p>For me that came in the form of unreliable strength and mobility. It rocked my world.  I fought, made concessions, adapted, found new purpose, only to have “life happened” again.  And I’d have to start all over.  Over nearly four decades, increasingly unreliable strength and mobility had gradually stripped me of the things that gave my life meaning: cooking and sewing for my sons, teaching high school math, operating my own résumé writing business, driving a car, and even dancing.  I received loving care.  All my needs were met; but I longed for purpose.  After five years of being a reclusive invalid, that longing led me to the on-line summit where Dr. Bradley Nelson spoke.   His words intrigued me.  His YouTube videos fascinated me.  What did I have to lose, so I called a Body Code practitioner.</p>
						<p>That first call lasted 20 minutes, but afterwards I had significantly more strength.  It was weird, incredible and felt like magic, but for the first time in twenty years, I had hope.  In subsequent calls the results varied; sometimes they were immense and mind-blowing; other times they were subtle and made themselves known over time.  Always my life improved physically, emotionally, and/or mentally.   I began relating others with growing compassion and effectiveness.  The way people interacted with me became kinder, more inclusive and considerate.  Opportunities for growth began appearing.</p>
						<p>In sixteen months after that first call, I had transformed from a recluse, who watched the world go by from a second-story window, to a Certified Body Code Practitioner and a radio host with a following of over 5000 listeners.</p> 
						<p>My heart sang when a client told me, “Your Body Code work has made my whole neighborhood a better place to live.”  My gratitude is unending. </p>
