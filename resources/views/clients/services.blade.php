          <h3>Body Code</h3>
          <p>"The Body Code is a form of energy work, where we identify and correct the different imbalances that cause all kinds of physical and emotional problems for people. A lot of it deals with the health of the energy body where we release trapped emotional energieis (emotional baggage) and correct blocked chakras and meridians and such. There is a physical side as well where we look for things like infections, toxins, nutritional defiencies and structural imbalances and address those according to whatever the clients body needs. Basically, this work is all about removing imbalance in order to make conditions right for the body to heal itself." Dr. Bradley Nelson</p>
