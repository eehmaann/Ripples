                   <div class="panel-body"><p>I found Vera and the Body Code through a friend's 
                    reccomendation.  Living a better life was a goal of mine and yet there were a 
                    number of things holding me 
                    back. I've had physical and emotional traumas in my life that have left 
                    lingering effects.   After the first call I knew I had found a key piece I 
                    needed  to improve things and reach my goal.  I have worked with Vera resolving 
                    physical, emotional and belief blocks.  She is kind, caring, genuine, and takes 
                    the time needed to make sure I understand the process.  It is apparent to me 
                    she has a gift which gives her the ability to put me at ease while dealing with 
                    some very delicate details.  I am so very thankful to have found her and I am 
                    looking forward to living my best life with her help.  I have already 
                    reccommended her to another friend of mine and would be comfortable referring 
                    anyone I know to her.</p></div>

                        <p>I was suffering from bleeding hemorrhoids for years and tried to heal myself 
                            with serveral over the counter home alternatives and herbs that only work to 
                            temporary.  I research surgery and found out that pain in recovery was not 
                            something I was willing to go through, but it was my last choice.</p>  

                        <p>I felt immediate relief from one body code session.  My bleeding in inflammation 
                            stopped.  I am now able to go about my day pain free without feeling 
                            uncomfortable.  Thank you, Vera, very much for your Body Code and Emotion 
                            Code work.</p></div>

                        <p>When I first emailed Vera, I did it more to appease a friend.  I am very 
                        skeptical of such things and did not go into this with any true belief.</p>  
                        <p>However, the proof is in the pudding, as they say. I woke up a few days after 
                        our session and it was as if someone power washed my soul. I have always felt my 
                        strong negative emotions in my solar plexus, and now I feel a sense of release, 
                        when I once held all my sorrow, fear, and disappointment.  I still find it hard 
                        to believe, but I am grateful!  When I do have a negative emotion, I feel it 
                        with less intensity and am able to look at it for what it really is and then 
                        let it go.</p>
                        <p>I have also noticed that people are being nicer to me.  Maybe they sense my calm, 
                        or energy has changed.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>I'm in a 12 step program and have been writing out my 4th step inventory and it 
                            was really getting tough.  It was loaded with brutal trauma from a certain age 
                            of which I had never told anyone about.  Vera Ehmann's Body Code and Emotion 
                            Code work picked up on it and she did the appropriate adjustments.  How she 
                            could have done this is totally unbelievable, to say the least.  Days after my 
                            writings she sent me an email describing what she had found at age 6;  it was as
                             if she had somehow read what I wrote. I'm in Florida and she's in Massachusetts.  
                         This proved to me that her work was for real.</p>
                        <p>I had mentioned to her how exhausted and down I had been feeling lately; I 
                            decided to trust her and let her do her work.  At first, I really felt even more
                             exhausted than prior, but soon afterward I felt better than ever.  Before the 
                             session, I was spiraling downward into a deep depression, and a few days after 
                         the session I was doing much much better.</p>
                        <p>This happened over and over again each time and every session just gets better 
                        and better.</p>
                        <p>This circumstance was so amazing that I sent my 12 step program sponsor the email
                         that she sends out after the therapy to compare with what I had written and he 
                         agreed that it was eerily similar.  She's sensitive, honest and trustworthy and 
                         goes above and beyond.  Her treatments should compliment any modality you are 
                         already using or use it as a stand-alone process.  If you are serious about 
                     resolving issues that evade the medical profession give her a call.</p></div>

                    <p>A little over a decade ago I broke my arm in an accident at work that left me 
                        with acute pain in my elbow and intermittent pain in my shoulder.  My job is 
                        extremely physically demanding, so I was grateful to be able to continue 
                        working.  However, at times I had to use over-the-counter pain-killers to get 
                        through the day.  After the first ssession with Vera, the pain was so 
                        dramatically reduced, I was stunned.  A couple weeks later, I was able to play 
                        football at a neighborhood block party all evening with no complaints from my 
                        shoulder.  It is great to be pain free again."</p>

                        <p>My husband and I adopted a three-year old rescue dog.  He was calm when 
                            he was home alone with me.  But as soon as my husband came home the 
                            Labrador would dart into his crate.  If the dog was out and my husband 
                            reached down to pet him, the dog would crouch in fear.</p>

                        <p>Our dog was much more affectionate the day after Vera worked on his 
                            behalf.  When my husband came home, the Labrador did not rush to his 
                            crate; he even allowed my husband to pet him without recoiling.  
                            After the next session the rescue dog began playing with our other dog.  
                        We are so grateful for the Body Code and Vera."</p>

                        <p>My poor, little 13 years old dog was listless and ill.  She was not eating.  
                        Sadly, the veterinarian had found several masses on her stomach, but felt 
                        my dog was too weak to survive the surgery.  After Vera completed the Body 
                        Code session, my dog started eating.  Soon she was joyful and running 
                        around.  Three months later, she is still happy and has no need for surgery.</p>
